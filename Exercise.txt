File System & JSON:

1. Print the current working directory
2. Create 2 text files, read them, print them to the console
3. Create 2 directories, 2 files with @ at the beginning of their names, 2 json files. Print the names of the JSON files ONLY (while reading the entire directory)
4. Manipulate the JSON files - add a “dependencies” key to the JSON with some key and values and save it.
5. Asynchronous - read about it, learn it, do it.
